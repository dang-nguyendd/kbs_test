Atrial fibrillation,"Atrial fibrillation (AFib) is an irregular and often very rapid heart rhythm. An irregular heart rhythm is called an arrhythmia.AFibcan lead to blood clots in the heart. The condition also increases the risk of stroke, heart failure and other heart-related complications.
During atrial fibrillation, the heart's upper chambers — called the atria — beat chaotically and irregularly. They beat out of sync with the lower heart chambers, called the ventricles. For many people,AFibmay have no symptoms. ButAFibmay cause a fast, pounding heartbeat, shortness of breath or light-headedness.
Episodes of atrial fibrillation may come and go, or they may be persistent.AFibitself usually isn't life-threatening. But it's a serious medical condition that needs proper treatment to prevent stroke.
Treatment for atrial fibrillation may include medicines, therapy to shock the heart back to a regular rhythm and procedures to block faulty heart signals.
A person with atrial fibrillation also may have a related heart rhythm problem called atrial flutter. The treatments forAFiband atrial flutter are similar.","Symptoms ofAFibmay include:
Feelings of a fast, fluttering or pounding heartbeat, called palpitations.
Chest pain.
Dizziness.
Fatigue.
Lightheadedness.
Reduced ability to exercise.
Shortness of breath.
Weakness.
Some people with atrial fibrillation (AFib) don't notice any symptoms.
Atrial fibrillation may be:
Occasional, also called paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.AFibsymptoms come and go. The symptoms usually last for a few minutes to hours. Some people have symptoms for as long as a week. The episodes can happen repeatedly. Symptoms might go away on their own. Some people with occasionalAFibneed treatment.
Persistent.The irregular heartbeat is constant. The heart rhythm does not reset on its own. If symptoms occur, medical treatment is needed to correct the heart rhythm.
Long-standing persistent.This type ofAFibis constant and lasts longer than 12 months. Medicines or a procedure are needed to correct the irregular heartbeat.
Permanent.In this type of atrial fibrillation, the irregular heart rhythm can't be reset. Medicines are needed to control the heart rate and to prevent blood clots.","To understand the causes of atrial fibrillation (AFib), it may be helpful to know how the heart typically beats.
The heart has four chambers:
The two upper chambers are called the atria.
The two lower chambers are called the ventricles.
Inside the upper right heart chamber is a group of cells called the sinus node. The sinus node makes the signals that starts each heartbeat.
The signals move across the upper heart chambers. Next, the signals arrive at a group of cells called theAVnode, where they usually slow down. The signals then go to the lower heart chambers.
In a healthy heart, this signaling process usually goes smoothly. The resting heart rate is typically 60 to 100 beats a minute.
But in atrial fibrillation, the signals in the upper chambers of the heart are chaotic. As a result, the upper chambers tremble or shake. TheAVnode is flooded with signals trying to get through to the lower heart chambers. This causes a fast and irregular heart rhythm.
In people withAFib, the heart rate may range from 100 to 175 beats a minute.","Healthy lifestyle choices can reduce the risk of heart disease and may prevent atrial fibrillation (AFib). Here are some basic heart-healthy tips:
Control high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes.
Don't smoke or use tobacco.
Eat a diet that's low in salt and saturated fat.
Exercise at least 30 minutes a day on most days of the week unless your health care team says not to.
Get good sleep. Adults should aim for 7 to 9 hours daily.
Maintain a healthy weight.
Reduce and manage stress.","You may not know you have atrial fibrillation (AFib). The condition may be found when a health checkup is done for another reason.
To diagnoseAFib, the health care provider examines you and asks questions about your medical history and symptoms. Tests may be done to look for conditions that can cause irregular heartbeats, such as heart disease or thyroid disease.","The goals of atrial fibrillation treatment are to reset and control the heartbeat and prevent blood clots.
Treatment depends on:
How long you've hadAFib.
Your symptoms.
The cause of the irregular heartbeat.
Atrial fibrillation treatment may involve:
Medicine.
Therapy to reset the heart rhythm, called cardioversion.
Surgery or catheter procedures.
Together, you and your health care team discuss the best treatment option for you. It's important to follow your atrial fibrillation treatment plan. IfAFibisn't well controlled, it may lead to other complications, including stroke and heart failure.","If you have an irregular or pounding heartbeat, make an appointment for a health checkup. IfAFibis found early, treatment may be easier, and it may work better. You may be referred to a doctor trained in heart diseases. This type of provider is called a cardiologist.
Here's some information to help you prepare for your appointment.","fatigue, weakness, pounding, chest pain, palpitations, atrial fibrillation, lightheadedness, dizziness, afib, shortness of breath"
Hyperhidrosis,"Hyperhidrosis (hi-pur-hi-DROE-sis) is excessive sweating that's not always related to heat or exercise. You may sweat so much that it soaks through your clothes or drips off your hands. Heavy sweating can disrupt your day and cause social anxiety and embarrassment.
Hyperhidrosis treatment usually helps. It often begins with antiperspirants. If these don't help, you may need to try different medications and therapies. In severe cases, your health care provider may suggest surgery to remove the sweat glands or to disconnect the nerves related to producing too much sweat.
Sometimes an underlying condition may be found and treated.","The main symptom of hyperhidrosis is heavy sweating. This goes beyond the sweating from being in a hot environment, exercising, or feeling anxious or stressed. The type of hyperhidrosis that usually affects the hands, feet, underarms or face causes at least one episode a week when you're awake. And the sweating usually happens on both sides of the body.","Sweating is the body's mechanism to cool itself. The nervous system automatically triggers sweat glands when your body temperature rises. Sweating also occurs, especially on your palms, when you're nervous.
Primary hyperhidrosis is caused by faulty nerve signals that trigger eccrine sweat glands to become overactive. It usually affects the palms, soles, underarms and sometimes the face.
There is no medical cause for this type of hyperhidrosis. It can run in families.
Secondary hyperhidrosis is caused by an underlying medical condition or by taking certain medications, such as pain relievers, antidepressants, and some diabetes and hormonal medications. This type of hyperhidrosis may cause sweating all over the body. Conditions that might cause it include:
Diabetes
Menopause hot flashes
Thyroid problems
Some types of cancer
Nervous system disorders
Infections",,Diagnosing hyperhidrosis may start with your health care provider asking about your medical history and symptoms. You may also need a physical exam or tests to further evaluate the cause of your symptoms.,"Treating hyperhidrosis may start with treating the condition causing it. If a cause isn't found, treatment focuses on controlling heavy sweating. If new self-care habits don't improve your symptoms, your health care provider may suggest one or more of the following treatments. Even if your sweating improves after treatment, it may recur.","You may start by seeing your primary care provider. You may then be referred to a specialist in diagnosing and treating conditions of the hair and skin (dermatologist). If your condition is not responding to treatment, you may be referred to a specialist in the nervous system (neurologist) or a surgeon.
Here's some information to help you get ready for your appointment.","heavy sweating, stressed, hyperhidrosis, anxious"
Bartholin's cyst,"The Bartholin's (BAHR-toe-linz) glands are located on each side of the vaginal opening. These glands secrete fluid that helps lubricate the vagina.

Sometimes the openings of these glands become obstructed, causing fluid to back up into the gland. The result is relatively painless swelling called a Bartholin's cyst. If the fluid within the cyst becomes infected, you may develop a collection of pus surrounded by inflamed tissue (abscess).

A Bartholin's cyst or abscess is common. Treatment of a Bartholin's cyst depends on the size of the cyst, how painful the cyst is and whether the cyst is infected.

Sometimes home treatment is all you need. In other cases, surgical drainage of the Bartholin's cyst is necessary. If an infection occurs, antibiotics may be helpful to treat the infected Bartholin's cyst.","If you have a small, noninfected Bartholin's cyst, you may not notice it. If the cyst grows, you might feel a lump or mass near your vaginal opening. Although a cyst is usually painless, it can be tender.

A full-blown infection of a Bartholin's cyst can occur in a matter of days. If the cyst becomes infected, you may experience:

A Bartholin's cyst or abscess typically occurs on only one side of the vaginal opening.","Experts believe that the cause of a Bartholin's cyst is a backup of fluid. Fluid may accumulate when the opening of the gland (duct) becomes obstructed, perhaps caused by infection or injury.

A Bartholin's cyst can become infected, forming an abscess. A number of bacteria may cause the infection, including Escherichia coli (E. coli) and bacteria that cause sexually transmitted infections such as gonorrhea and chlamydia.","There's no way to prevent a Bartholin's cyst. However, safer sex practices — in particular, using condoms — and good hygiene habits may help to prevent infection of a cyst and the formation of an abscess.","To diagnose a Bartholin's cyst, your doctor may:

If cancer is a concern, your doctor may refer you to a gynecologist who specializes in cancers of the female reproductive system.","Often a Bartholin's cyst requires no treatment — especially if the cyst causes no signs or symptoms. When needed, treatment depends on the size of the cyst, your discomfort level and whether it's infected, which can result in an abscess.

Treatment options your doctor may recommend include:

Surgical drainage.You may need surgery to drain a cyst that's infected or very large. Drainage of a cyst can be done using local anesthesia or sedation.

For the procedure, your doctor makes a small incision in the cyst, allows it to drain, and then places a small rubber tube (catheter) in the incision. The catheter stays in place for up to six weeks to keep the incision open and allow complete drainage.

Rarely, for persistent cysts that aren't effectively treated by the above procedures, your doctor may recommend surgery to remove the Bartholin's gland. Surgical removal is usually done in a hospital under general anesthesia. Surgical removal of the gland carries a greater risk of bleeding or complications after the procedure.",Your first appointment will likely be with either your primary care provider or a doctor who specializes in conditions that affect women (gynecologist).,"abscess, pain, tender, infection, lump, mass"
Infant reflux,"Infant reflux is when a baby spits up liquid or food. It happens when stomach contents move back up from a baby's stomach into the esophagus. The esophagus is the muscular tube that connects the mouth to the stomach.
Reflux happens in infants many times a day. If your baby is content and growing well, reflux is not a cause for concern. Sometimes called gastroesophageal reflux, also called GER, the condition becomes less common as a baby gets older. It's unusual for infant reflux to continue after age 18 months.
Rarely, infant reflux leads to weight loss or growth that lags behind that of other children of the same age and sex. These symptoms may mean that your baby has a medical issue. This issue could be an allergy, a blockage in the digestive system or gastroesophageal reflux disease, also called GERD. GERD is a form of GER that causes serious health issues.","Most of the time, infant reflux isn't a cause for concern. It's not usual for stomach contents to have enough acid to irritate the throat or esophagus and cause symptoms.","In infants, the ring of muscle between the esophagus and the stomach is not yet fully developed. This muscle is called the lower esophageal sphincter, also known as LES. When the LES is not fully developed, it allows stomach contents to flow back up into the esophagus. Over time, the LES typically matures. It opens when a baby swallows and remains tightly closed at other times, keeping stomach contents where they belong.
Some factors that contribute to infant reflux are common in babies and often can't be avoided. These include lying flat most of the time and being fed an almost completely liquid diet.
Sometimes, infant reflux can be caused by more-serious conditions, such as:
GERD.The reflux has enough acid to irritate and damage the lining of the esophagus.
Pyloric stenosis.A muscular valve allows food to leave the stomach and enter the small intestine as part of digestion. In pyloric stenosis, the valve thickens and becomes larger than it should. The thickened valve then traps food in the stomach and blocks it from entering the small intestine.
Food intolerance.A protein in cow's milk is the most common trigger.
Eosinophilic esophagitis.A certain type of white blood cell builds up and injures the lining of the esophagus. This white blood cell is called an eosinophil.
Sandifer syndrome.This causes tilting and rotation of the head that are not usual and movements that look like seizures. It's a rare complication of GERD.",,"To diagnose infant reflux, a healthcare professional typically starts with a physical exam and asks questions about a baby's symptoms. If a baby is growing as expected and seems content, then testing usually isn't needed. In some cases, however, a healthcare professional might recommend:
Ultrasound.This imaging test can detect pyloric stenosis.
Lab tests.Blood and urine tests can help find or rule out possible causes of poor weight gain and vomiting that happens often.
Esophageal pH monitoring.To measure the acidity in a baby's esophagus, the health professional places a thin tube through the baby's nose or mouth and into the esophagus. The tube is attached to a device that monitors acidity. A baby might need to stay in the hospital while being monitored.
X-rays.These images can detect problems in the digestive tract, such as a blockage. A baby may be given a contrast liquid with a bottle before the test. This liquid is usually barium.
Upper endoscopy.An upper endoscopy uses a tiny camera on the end of a flexible tube called an endoscope to visually examine the upper digestive system. Tissue samples may be taken for analysis. For infants and children, endoscopy usually is done under general anesthesia. General anesthesia causes a sleeplike state before surgery or other medical procedures.","For most babies, making some changes to feeding eases infant reflux until it gets better on its own.","You may start by seeing your baby's primary healthcare team. Or you may be referred to a specialist in children's digestive diseases, called a pediatric gastroenterologist.","reflux, throat, irritate the throat, irritate the esophagus"
Hidradenitis suppurativa,"Hidradenitis suppurativa (hi-drad-uh-NIE-tis sup-yoo-ruh-TIE-vuh), also known as acne inversa, is a condition that causes small, painful lumps to form under the skin. The lumps usually develop in areas where your skin rubs together, such as the armpits, groin, buttocks and breasts. The lumps heal slowly, recur, and can lead to tunnels under the skin and scarring.
Hidradenitis suppurativa tends to start after puberty, usually before age 40. It can persist for many years and worsen over time. It can affect your daily life and emotional well-being. Combined medical and surgical therapy can help manage the disease and prevent complications.
Women are three times more likely to develop hidradenitis suppurativa, though this ratio can differ by location around the world. Also, Black people are more likely to develop this disease than people of other races. This could be attributed to genetic factors.","Hidradenitis suppurativa can affect one or several areas of the body. Signs and symptoms of the condition include:
Blackheads.Blackheads appear in small, pitted areas of skin, often appearing in pairs.
Painful pea-sized lumps.The condition usually starts with a single, painful lump under the skin that persists for weeks or months. More bumps may form later, usually in areas where you have more sweat and oil glands or where the skin rubs together, such as the armpits, groin, buttocks and breasts.
Leaking bumps or sores.Some bumps or sores get bigger, break open and drain pus with an odor.
Tunnels.Over time, tunnels might form under the skin, connecting the lumps. These wounds heal slowly, if at all, and drain blood and pus.
Some people with this condition experience only mild symptoms. The course of the disease is highly variable. Excess weight and being a smoker are associated with worse symptoms, but people who are thin and don't smoke can experience severe disease.","Hidradenitis suppurativa develops when hair follicles become blocked, but why this blockage occurs isn't known. Experts think it could be connected to hormones, genetic predisposition, cigarette smoking or excess weight.
An infection or being unclean does not cause hidradenitis suppurativa, and it can't be spread to other people.",,"Hidradenitis suppurativa can be mistaken for pimples or acne. For many people, it takes years to receive a correct diagnosis.
Your health care provider will base a diagnosis on your signs and symptoms, skin appearance, and medical history. You might be referred to a health care provider who specializes in skin conditions, also known as a dermatologist. Hidradenitis suppurativa can be difficult to diagnose and requires specialized care.
No laboratory test is available to diagnose hidradenitis suppurativa. But if pus or drainage is present, your health care provider might take a sample for lab testing.","Treatment with medicines, surgery or both can help control symptoms and prevent complications of hidradenitis suppurativa. Talk with your health care provider about the risks and benefits of the treatment options and how to develop an approach that's right for you.
Expect to have regular follow-up visits with your dermatologist. Some people might need the comprehensive care provided by a health care team with members from multiple medical specialties.","You'll likely first see your primary care provider. You might then be referred to a health care provider who specializes in diagnosing and treating skin diseases, also known as a dermatologist. Depending on the severity of your condition, your care also might involve specialists in colorectal surgery, plastic surgery or gastroenterology.

HIV/AIDS,"Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), is an ongoing, also called chronic, condition. It's caused by the human immunodeficiency virus, also called HIV.HIVdamages the immune system so that the body is less able to fight infection and disease. IfHIVisn't treated, it can take years before it weakens the immune system enough to becomeAIDS. Thanks to treatment, most people in the U.S. don't getAIDS.
HIVis spread through contact with genitals, such as during sex without a condom. This type of infection is called a sexually transmitted infection, also called an STI.HIValso is spread through contact with blood, such as when people share needles or syringes. It is also possible for a person with untreatedHIVto spread the virus to a child during pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding.
There's no cure forHIV/AIDS. But medicines can control the infection and keep the disease from getting worse. Antiviral treatments forHIVhave reducedAIDSdeaths around the world. There's an ongoing effort to make ways to prevent and treatHIV/AIDSmore available in resource-poor countries.",The symptoms ofHIVandAIDSvary depending on the person and the phase of infection.,"HIVis caused by a virus. It can spread through sexual contact, shooting of illicit drugs or use of shared needles, and contact with infected blood. It also can spread from parent to child during pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding.
HIVdestroys white blood cells called CD4 T cells. These cells play a large role in helping the body fight disease. The fewer CD4 T cells you have, the weaker your immune system becomes.","There's no vaccine to preventHIVinfection and no cure forHIV/AIDS. But you can protect yourself and others from infection.
To help prevent the spread ofHIV:
Consider preexposure prophylaxis, also called PrEP.There are twoPrEPmedicines taken by mouth, also called oral, and onePrEPmedicine given in the form of a shot, called injectable. The oral medicines are emtricitabine-tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Truvada) and emtricitabine-tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (Descovy). The injectable medicine is called cabotegravir (Apretude).PrEPcan reduce the risk of sexually transmittedHIVinfection in people at very high risk.PrEPcan reduce the risk of gettingHIVfrom sex by about 99% and from injecting drugs by at least 74%, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Descovy hasn't been studied in people who have sex by having a penis put into their vaginas, called receptive vaginal sex.Cabotegravir (Apretude) is the first U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approvedPrEPthat can be given as a shot to reduce the risk of sexually transmittedHIVinfection in people at very high risk. A healthcare professional gives the shot. After two once-monthly shots, Apretude is given every two months. The shot is an option in place of a dailyPrEPpill.Your healthcare professional prescribes these medicines to preventHIVonly to people who don't already haveHIVinfection. You need anHIVtest before you start taking anyPrEP. You need to take the test every three months for the pills or before each shot for as long as you takePrEP.You need to take the pills every day or closely follow the shot schedule. You still need to practice safe sex to protect against otherSTIs. If you have hepatitis B, you should see an infectious disease or liver specialist before beginningPrEPtherapy.
Use treatment as prevention, also called TasP.If you haveHIV, takingHIVmedicines can keep your partner from getting infected with the virus. If your blood tests show no virus, that means your viral load can't be detected. Then you won't transmit the virus to anyone else through sex.If you useTasP, you must take your medicines exactly as prescribed and get regular checkups.
Use post-exposure prophylaxis, also called PEP, if you've been exposed toHIV.If you think you've been exposed through sex, through needles or in the workplace, contact your healthcare professional or go to an emergency room. TakingPEPas soon as you can within the first 72 hours can greatly reduce your risk of gettingHIV. You need to take the medicine for 28 days.
Use a new condom every time you have anal or vaginal sex.Both male and female condoms are available. If you use a lubricant, make sure it's water based. Oil-based lubricants can weaken condoms and cause them to break.During oral sex, use a cut-open condom or a piece of medical-grade latex called a dental dam without a lubricant.
Tell your sexual partners you haveHIV.It's important to tell all your current and past sexual partners that you'reHIVpositive. They need to be tested.
Use clean needles.If you use needles to inject illicit drugs, make sure the needles are sterile. Don't share them. Use needle-exchange programs in your community. Seek help for your drug use.
If you're pregnant, get medical care right away.You can passHIVto your baby. But if you get treatment during pregnancy, you can lessen your baby's risk greatly.
Consider male circumcision.Studies show that removing the foreskin from the penis, called circumcision, can help reduce the risk of gettingHIVinfection.","HIVcan be diagnosed through blood or saliva testing. Tests include:
Antigen-antibody tests.These tests most often use blood from a vein. Antigens are substances on theHIVvirus itself. They most often show up in the blood within a few weeks after being exposed toHIV.The immune system makes antibodies when it's exposed toHIV. It can take weeks to months for antibodies to show up in blood. You may not show a positive result on an antigen-antibody test until 2 to 6 weeks after exposure toHIV.
Antibody tests.These tests look for antibodies toHIVin blood or saliva. Most rapidHIVtests are antibody tests. This includes self-tests done at home. You may not show a positive result on an antibody test until 3 to 12 weeks after you've been exposed toHIV.
Nucleic acid tests (NATs).These tests look for the virus in your blood, called viral load. They use blood from a vein.If you might have been exposed toHIVwithin the past few weeks, your healthcare professional may suggestNAT.NATis the first test to become positive after exposure toHIV.
Talk with your healthcare professional about whichHIVtest is right for you. If any of these tests are negative, you may need a follow-up test weeks to months later to confirm the results.","There's no cure forHIV/AIDS. Once you have the infection, your body can't get rid of it. But there are medicines that can controlHIVand prevent complications.
Everyone diagnosed withHIVshould take antiretroviral therapy medicines, also called ART. This is true no matter what stage the disease is in or what the complications are.
ARTis usually a mix of two or more medicines from several classes. This approach has the best chance of lowering the amount ofHIVin the blood. There are manyARToptions that mix more than oneHIVmedicine into a single pill, taken once daily.
Each class of medicines blocks the virus in different ways. Treatment involves mixing medicines from different classes to:
Account for medicine resistance, called viral genotype.
Keep from creating new medicine-resistant strains ofHIV.
Suppress the virus in the blood as much as possible.
Two medicines from one class, plus a third medicine from another class, are most often used.
The classes of anti-HIVmedicines include the following:
Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs)turn off a protein needed byHIVto make copies of itself.Examples include efavirenz, rilpivirine (Edurant) and doravirine (Pifeltro).
Nucleoside or nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs)are faulty versions of the building blocks thatHIVneeds to make copies of itself.Examples include abacavir (Ziagen), tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Viread), emtricitabine (Emtriva), lamivudine (Epivir) and zidovudine (Retrovir). Retrovir is no longer suggested for routine use in the U.S. because of high rates of toxic effects.Mixes of medicines also are available, such as emtricitabine-tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Truvada) and emtricitabine-tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (Descovy).
Protease inhibitors (PIs)makeHIVprotease inactive.HIVprotease is another protein thatHIVneeds to make copies of itself.Examples include atazanavir (Reyataz), darunavir (Prezista) and lopinavir-ritonavir (Kaletra).
Integrase inhibitorsstop the action of a protein called integrase.HIVuses integrase to put its genetic material into CD4 T cells.Examples include bictegravir sodium-emtricitabine-tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (Biktarvy), raltegravir (Isentress), dolutegravir (Tivicay) and cabotegravir (Vocabria).
Entry or fusion inhibitorsblockHIV'sentry into CD4 T cells.Examples include enfuvirtide (Fuzeon) and maraviroc (Selzentry). Newer medicines include ibalizumab-uiyk (Trogarzo) and fostemsavir (Rukobia).","If you think you might have anHIVinfection, you're likely to start by seeing your family healthcare professional. You may be sent to an infectious disease specialist who focuses on treatingHIV/AIDS.",infection
Acute myelogenous leukemia,"Acute myelogenous leukemia, also called AML, is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow. Bone marrow is the soft matter inside bones where blood cells are made.
The word ""acute"" in acute myelogenous leukemia means the disease tends to get worse quickly. It's called myelogenous (my-uh-LOHJ-uh-nus) leukemia because it affects cells called the myeloid cells. These typically develop into mature blood cells, including red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets.
AML is the most common type of acute leukemia in adults. The other type is acute lymphoblastic leukemia, also called ALL. Although AML can be diagnosed at any age, it is less common before age 45. AML also is called acute myeloid leukemia, acute myeloblastic leukemia, acute granulocytic leukemia and acute nonlymphocytic leukemia.
Unlike other cancers, there are no numbered stages of acute myelogenous leukemia.","Symptoms of acute myelogenous leukemia may include:
Fever.
Pain. Common places for pain include the bones, back and stomach.
Feeling very tired.
Paleness or change in skin color.
Frequent infections.
Easy bruising.
Bleeding with no clear cause, such as in the nose or gums.
Shortness of breath.","It's often not clear what causes acute myelogenous leukemia.
Healthcare professionals know that it starts when something causes changes to the DNA inside cells in the bone marrow. The bone marrow is the spongy material inside bones. It's where blood cells are made.
The changes that lead to acute myelogenous leukemia are thought to happen in cells called myeloid cells. Myeloid cells are bone marrow cells that can turn into the blood cells that circulate through the body. Healthy myeloid cells can become:
Red blood cells, which carry oxygen to the body.
Platelets, which help stop bleeding.
White blood cells, which help fight infections.
Every cell in the body contains DNA. A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell the cell what to do. In healthy cells, the DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate. The instructions tell the cells to die at a set time. But when the DNA changes happen in the myeloid cells, the changes give different instructions. The myeloid cells start to make a lot of extra cells, and they don't stop.
The DNA changes cause the myeloid cells to make a lot of immature white blood cells, called myeloblasts. The myeloblasts don't work right. They can build up in the bone marrow. They can crowd out healthy blood cells. Without enough healthy blood cells, there might be low oxygen levels in the blood, easy bruising and bleeding, and frequent infections.",,"Acute myeloid leukemia diagnosis often begins with an exam that checks for bruising, bleeding in the mouth or gums, infection, and swollen lymph nodes. Other tests include blood and lab tests, bone marrow biopsy, lumbar puncture, and imaging.
Tests and exams to diagnose acute myelogenous leukemia, also called AML, include:","Many types of treatment exist for acute myelogenous leukemia, also called AML. Treatment depends on several factors, including the subtype of the disease, your age, your overall health, your prognosis and your preferences.
Treatment usually has two phases:
Remission induction therapy.This first phase aims to kill the leukemia cells in your blood and bone marrow. But it doesn't usually destroy all the leukemia cells. You will need further treatment to keep the disease from coming back.
Consolidation therapy.This phase also is called post-remission therapy or maintenance therapy. It aims to kill the remaining leukemia cells. Consolidation therapy is crucial to helping lower the risk of relapse.
Treatments include:
Chemotherapy.Chemotherapy treats cancer with strong medicines. Most chemotherapy medicines are given through a vein. Some come in pill form. Chemotherapy is the main type of remission induction therapy. It also may be used for consolidation therapy.
People with AML usually stay in the hospital during chemotherapy treatments because the medicines kill many healthy blood cells while destroying leukemia cells. If the first chemotherapy cycle doesn't cause remission, it can be repeated.
Side effects of chemotherapy depend on the medicines you're given. Common side effects are nausea and hair loss. Serious, long-term complications may include heart disease, lung damage, fertility problems and other cancers.
Targeted therapy.Targeted therapy for cancer is a treatment that uses medicines that attack specific chemicals in the cancer cells. By blocking these chemicals, targeted treatments can cause cancer cells to die. Your leukemia cells will be tested to see if targeted therapy may be helpful for you. Targeted therapy may be used alone or in combination with chemotherapy during induction therapy.
Bone marrow transplant.A bone marrow transplant, also called a bone marrow stem cell transplant, involves putting healthy bone marrow stem cells into the body. These cells replace cells hurt by chemotherapy and other treatments. A bone marrow stem cell transplant may be used for both remission induction and consolidation therapy.
Before a bone marrow transplant, you receive very high doses of chemotherapy or radiation therapy to destroy your leukemia-producing bone marrow. Then you receive infusions of stem cells from a compatible donor. This is called an allogeneic transplant.
There is an increased risk of infection after a transplant.
Clinical trials.Some people with leukemia choose to enroll in clinical trials to try experimental treatments or new combinations of known therapies.","Make an appointment with your healthcare professional if you have symptoms that worry you. You may be referred to a doctor who specializes in blood cell diseases. This type of doctor is called a hematologist.
Appointments can be brief, and there's a lot of information to discuss. It's a good idea to be prepared. Here's some information to help you get ready:","pain, fever, bleeding, tired, infections, paleness, shortness of breath, bruising, acute myelogenous leukemia"
Guillain-Barre syndrome,"Guillain-Barre (gee-YAH-buh-RAY) syndrome is a condition in which the body's immune system attacks the nerves. It can cause weakness, numbness or paralysis.
Weakness and tingling in the hands and feet are usually the first symptoms. These sensations can quickly spread and may lead to paralysis. In its most serious form, Guillain-Barre syndrome is a medical emergency. Most people with the condition need treatment in a hospital.
Guillain-Barre syndrome is rare, and the exact cause is not known. But two-thirds of people have symptoms of an infection in the six weeks before Guillain-Barre symptoms begin. Infections can include a respiratory or a gastrointestinal infection, includingCOVID-19. Guillain-Barre also can be caused by the Zika virus.
There's no known cure for Guillain-Barre syndrome. Several treatment options can ease symptoms and help speed recovery. Most people recover completely from Guillain-Barre syndrome, but some serious illnesses can be fatal. While recovery may take up to several years, most people are able to walk again six months after symptoms first began. Some people may have lasting effects, such as weakness, numbness or fatigue.","Guillain-Barre syndrome often begins with tingling and weakness starting in the feet and legs and spreading to the upper body and arms. Some people notice the first symptoms in the arms or face. As Guillain-Barre syndrome progresses, muscle weakness can turn into paralysis.
Symptoms of Guillain-Barre syndrome may include:
A pins and needles feeling in the fingers, toes, ankles or wrists.
Weakness in the legs that spreads to the upper body.
Unsteady walk or not being able to walk or climb stairs.
Trouble with facial movements, including speaking, chewing or swallowing.
Double vision or inability to move the eyes.
Severe pain that may feel achy, shooting or cramplike and may be worse at night.
Trouble with bladder control or bowel function.
Rapid heart rate.
Low or high blood pressure.
Trouble breathing.
People with Guillain-Barre syndrome usually experience their most significant weakness within two weeks after symptoms begin.","The exact cause of Guillain-Barre syndrome isn't known. It usually appears days or weeks after a respiratory or digestive tract infection. Rarely, recent surgery or vaccination can trigger Guillain-Barre syndrome.
In Guillain-Barre syndrome, your immune system — which usually attacks only invading organisms — begins attacking the nerves. InAIDP, the nerves' protective covering, known as the myelin sheath, is damaged. The damage prevents nerves from transmitting signals to your brain, causing weakness, numbness or paralysis.
Guillain-Barre syndrome may be triggered by:
Most commonly, an infection with campylobacter, a type of bacteria often found in undercooked poultry.
Influenza virus.
Cytomegalovirus.
Epstein-Barr virus.
Zika virus.
Hepatitis A, B, C and E.
HIV, the virus that causesAIDS.
Mycoplasma pneumonia.
Surgery.
Trauma.
Hodgkin lymphoma.
Rarely, influenza vaccinations or childhood vaccinations.
COVID-19virus.",,"Guillain-Barre syndrome can be hard to diagnose in its earliest stages. Its symptoms are similar to those of other conditions and may vary from person to person.
Your healthcare professional starts with a medical history and thorough physical exam.
Your healthcare professional may then recommend:
Spinal tap, also known as a lumbar puncture.A small amount of fluid is withdrawn from the spinal canal in your lower back. The fluid is tested for a type of change that commonly occurs in people who have Guillain-Barre syndrome.
Electromyography.Thin-needle electrodes are inserted into the muscles to measure nerve activity.
Nerve conduction studies.Electrodes are taped to the skin above your nerves. A small shock is passed through the nerve to measure the speed of nerve signals.","There's no cure for Guillain-Barre syndrome. But two types of treatments can speed recovery and reduce symptoms:
Plasma exchange, also known as plasmapheresis.Plasma is the liquid portion of part of your blood. In a plasma exchange, plasma is removed and separated from your blood cells. The blood cells are then put back into your body, which makes more plasma to replace what was removed. Plasmapheresis may work by ridding plasma of certain antibodies that contribute to the immune system's attack on the peripheral nerves.
Immunoglobulin therapy.Immunoglobulin containing healthy antibodies from blood donors is given through a vein. High doses of immunoglobulin can block the damaging antibodies that may contribute to Guillain-Barre syndrome.
These treatments are equally effective. Mixing them or using one after the other is no more effective than using either method alone.
You are also likely to be given medicine to:
Relieve pain, which can be severe.
Prevent blood clots, which can develop if you're not mobile.
People with Guillain-Barre syndrome need physical help and therapy before and during recovery. Your care may include:
Movement of your arms and legs by caregivers before recovery, to help keep your muscles flexible and strong.
Physical therapy during recovery to help you cope with fatigue and regain strength and proper movement.
Training with adaptive devices, such as a wheelchair or braces, to give you mobility and self-care skills.","You may be referred to a doctor who specializes in disorders of the brain and nervous system, known as a neurologist.","pain, unsteady walk, achy, low blood pressure, weakness, severe pain, double vision, trouble breathing, rapid heart rate, tingling, muscle weakness, paralysis, high blood pressure, guillain-barre syndrome, tingling and weakness, pins and needles feeling, trouble with bladder control, trouble with facial movements"
Acute kidney injury,"Acute kidney injury happens when the kidneys suddenly can't filter waste products from the blood. When the kidneys can't filter wastes, harmful levels of wastes may build up. The blood's chemical makeup may get out of balance.
Acute kidney injury used to be called acute kidney failure. Acute kidney injury is most common in people who are in the hospital, mostly in people who need intensive care.
Acute kidney injury ranges from mild to severe. If severe, ongoing and not treated, it can be fatal. But it also can be reversed. People in otherwise good health may get back typical or nearly typical use of their kidneys.","Symptoms of acute kidney injury may include:
Less urine output.
Fluid buildup, which can cause shortness of breath and swelling in the legs, ankles or feet.
Tiredness.
Confusion or fogginess.
Nausea.
Pain in the belly or in the side below the rib cage.
Weakness.
Irregular heartbeat.
Itching.
Loss of appetite.
Chest pain or pressure.
Seizures or coma in severe cases.
Sometimes acute kidney injury causes no symptoms. Then it may be found through lab tests done for something else.","Acute kidney injury can happen when:
You have a condition that slows blood flow to your kidneys.
You have damage to your kidneys.
Your kidneys' urine drainage tubes, called ureters, get blocked.","You might cut your risk of acute kidney injury by taking care of your kidneys. Try to:
Get treated quickly for bad infections.
Work with your healthcare team to manage kidney and other ongoing conditions.Kidney disease, diabetes or high blood pressure increases your risk of acute kidney injury. If you have one of these, do what your healthcare team tells you to manage your condition.If you have risk factors for kidney disease, check with your healthcare team to be sure that prescription medicines you take are safe for your kidneys.
Read labels when taking pain medicines available without a prescription.Do what the label says when taking medicines such as aspirin, acetaminophen (Tylenol, others), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve). Taking too much of these medicines may increase your risk of kidney injury. This is especially true if you already have kidney disease, diabetes or high blood pressure.
Live a healthy lifestyle.Be active and eat a healthy, balanced diet. If you drink alcohol, drink only in moderation.","You might have the following tests to diagnose acute kidney injury:
Blood tests.A sample of your blood may show fast-rising levels of urea and creatinine. This helps show how your kidneys are working.
Urine output measures.Measuring how much urine you pass in 24 hours may help find the cause of your kidney failure.
Urine tests.A sample of your urine may show something that suggests a condition that might explain kidney failure. This is called urinalysis.
Imaging tests.Imaging tests such as ultrasound and CT scans can show your kidneys.
Removing a sample of kidney tissue for testing.Your healthcare professional may suggest removing a small sample of your kidney tissue for lab testing. This is called a biopsy. A needle put through your skin and into your kidney removes the sample.",Treatment for acute kidney injury most often means a hospital stay. Most people with acute kidney injury are already in the hospital. How long you'll stay in the hospital depends on the reason for your acute kidney injury and how quickly your kidneys recover.,"Most people are in a hospital when they get acute kidney injury. If you aren't in the hospital and have symptoms of kidney failure, make an appointment with your family healthcare professional right away. You may be referred to a specialist in kidney disease, called a nephrologist.
Before your appointment, write down questions. Consider asking:
What's the most likely cause of my symptoms?
Have my kidneys stopped working? What could have caused my kidney failure?
What tests do I need?
What are my treatment choices, and what are the risks?
Do I need to go to the hospital?
Will my kidneys recover or will I need dialysis?
I have other health conditions. How can I best manage these conditions together?
Do I need to eat a special diet? If so, can you refer me to a dietitian to help me plan what to eat?
Do you have printed materials about acute kidney injury that I can have? What websites do you suggest?","nausea, less urine output, swelling, pain in the side, shortness of breath, acute kidney injury, fogginess, tiredness, loss of appetite, itching, pain in the belly, loss of appetite., coma, fluid buildup, seizures, pain, weakness, chest pain, irregular heartbeat, confusion"
Acute lymphocytic leukemia,"Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) is a type of cancer of the blood and bone marrow — the spongy tissue inside bones where blood cells are made.
The word ""acute"" in acute lymphocytic leukemia comes from the fact that the disease progresses rapidly and creates immature blood cells, rather than mature ones. The word ""lymphocytic"" in acute lymphocytic leukemia refers to the white blood cells called lymphocytes, whichALLaffects. Acute lymphocytic leukemia is also known as acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
Acute lymphocytic leukemia is the most common type of cancer in children, and treatments result in a good chance for a cure. Acute lymphocytic leukemia can also occur in adults, though the chance of a cure is greatly reduced.","Signs and symptoms of acute lymphocytic leukemia may include:
Bleeding from the gums
Bone pain
Fever
Frequent infections
Frequent or severe nosebleeds
Lumps caused by swollen lymph nodes in and around the neck, armpits, abdomen or groin
Pale skin
Shortness of breath
Weakness, fatigue or a general decrease in energy","Acute lymphocytic leukemia occurs when a bone marrow cell develops changes (mutations) in its genetic material or DNA. A cell's DNA contains the instructions that tell a cell what to do. Normally, the DNA tells the cell to grow at a set rate and to die at a set time. In acute lymphocytic leukemia, the mutations tell the bone marrow cell to continue growing and dividing.
When this happens, blood cell production becomes out of control. The bone marrow produces immature cells that develop into leukemic white blood cells called lymphoblasts. These abnormal cells are unable to function properly, and they can build up and crowd out healthy cells.
It's not clear what causes the DNA mutations that can lead to acute lymphocytic leukemia.",,"Tests and procedures used to diagnose acute lymphocytic leukemia include:
Blood tests.Blood tests may reveal too many or too few white blood cells, not enough red blood cells, and not enough platelets. A blood test may also show the presence of blast cells — immature cells normally found in the bone marrow.
Bone marrow test.During bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, a needle is used to remove a sample of bone marrow from the hipbone or breastbone. The sample is sent to a lab for testing to look for leukemia cells.Doctors in the lab will classify blood cells into specific types based on their size, shape, and other genetic or molecular features. They also look for certain changes in the cancer cells and determine whether the leukemia cells began from B lymphocytes or T lymphocytes. This information helps your doctor develop a treatment plan.
Imaging tests.Imaging tests such as an X-ray, a computerized tomography (CT) scan or an ultrasound scan may help determine whether cancer has spread to the brain and spinal cord or other parts of the body.
Spinal fluid test.A lumbar puncture test, also called a spinal tap, may be used to collect a sample of spinal fluid — the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. The sample is tested to see whether cancer cells have spread to the spinal fluid.","In general, treatment for acute lymphocytic leukemia falls into separate phases:
Induction therapy.The purpose of the first phase of treatment is to kill most of the leukemia cells in the blood and bone marrow and to restore normal blood cell production.
Consolidation therapy.Also called post-remission therapy, this phase of treatment is aimed at destroying any remaining leukemia in the body.
Maintenance therapy.The third phase of treatment prevents leukemia cells from regrowing. The treatments used in this stage are usually given at much lower doses over a long period of time, often years.
Preventive treatment to the spinal cord.During each phase of therapy, people with acute lymphocytic leukemia may receive additional treatment to kill leukemia cells located in the central nervous system. In this type of treatment, chemotherapy drugs are often injected directly into the fluid that covers the spinal cord.
Depending on your situation, the phases of treatment for acute lymphocytic leukemia can span two to three years.
Treatments may include:
Chemotherapy.Chemotherapy, which uses drugs to kill cancer cells, is typically used as an induction therapy for children and adults with acute lymphocytic leukemia. Chemotherapy drugs can also be used in the consolidation and maintenance phases.
Targeted therapy.Targeted drug treatments focus on specific abnormalities present within cancer cells. By blocking these abnormalities, targeted drug treatments can cause cancer cells to die. Your leukemia cells will be tested to see if targeted therapy may be helpful for you. Targeted therapy can be used alone or in combination with chemotherapy for induction therapy, consolidation therapy or maintenance therapy.
Radiation therapy.Radiation therapy uses high-powered beams, such as X-rays or protons, to kill cancer cells. If the cancer cells have spread to the central nervous system, your doctor may recommend radiation therapy.
Bone marrow transplant.A bone marrow transplant, also known as a stem cell transplant, may be used as consolidation therapy or for treating relapse if it occurs. This procedure allows someone with leukemia to reestablish healthy bone marrow by replacing leukemic bone marrow with leukemia-free marrow from a healthy person.A bone marrow transplant begins with high doses of chemotherapy or radiation to destroy any leukemia-producing bone marrow. The marrow is then replaced by bone marrow from a compatible donor (allogeneic transplant).
Engineering immune cells to fight leukemia.A specialized treatment called chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy takes your body's germ-fighting T cells, engineers them to fight cancer and infuses them back into your body.CAR-T cell therapy might be an option for children and young adults. It might be used for consolidation therapy or for treating relapse.
Clinical trials.Clinical trials are experiments to test new cancer treatments and new ways of using existing treatments. While clinical trials give you or your child a chance to try the latest cancer treatment, the benefits and risks of the treatment may be uncertain. Discuss the benefits and risks of clinical trials with your doctor.","Make an appointment with your family doctor if you or your child has signs and symptoms that worry you. If your doctor suspects acute lymphocytic leukemia, you'll likely be referred to a doctor who specializes in treating diseases and conditions of the blood and bone marrow (hematologist).
Because appointments can be brief, and because there's often a lot of information to discuss, it's a good idea to be prepared. Here's some information to help you get ready, and what to expect from the doctor.","pain, frequent infections, fatigue, weakness, nosebleeds, fever, frequent or severe nosebleeds, acute lymphocytic leukemia, infections, pale skin, bone pain, bleeding from the gums, shortness of breath, shortness of breath

Radiation sickness,"Radiation sickness is damage to the body caused by a large dose of radiation often received over a short time. This is called acute radiation sickness. The amount of radiation absorbed by the body, called the absorbed dose, determines how bad the illness will be.
Radiation sickness also is called acute radiation syndrome or radiation poisoning. Radiation sickness is not caused by common medical imaging tests that use low-dose radiation, such as X-rays, CT scans and nuclear medicine scans.
Although radiation sickness is serious and often fatal, it's rare. Since the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, during World War II, most cases of radiation sickness have occurred after nuclear industrial accidents, such as the 1986 fire that damaged the nuclear power plant at Chernobyl, Ukraine.","The severity of radiation sickness symptoms depends on how much radiation you've absorbed. How much you absorb depends on the strength of the radiated energy, the time of your exposures, and the distance between you and the source of radiation.
Symptoms also are affected by the type of exposure, such as total or partial body. The severity of radiation sickness also depends on how sensitive the affected tissue is. For instance, the gastrointestinal system and bone marrow are highly sensitive to radiation.","Radiation sickness is caused by being exposed to a high dose of radiation. Radiation is the energy released from atoms as either a wave or a tiny particle of matter.
Radiation sickness happens when high-energy radiation damages or destroys certain cells in the body. Areas of the body most at risk of being affected by high-energy radiation are the bone marrow cells and the lining of the intestinal tract.","In the event of a radiation emergency, listen to the radio or watch television to hear what protective actions local, state and federal authorities recommend. Those actions depend on the situation, but you will be told to either stay in place or evacuate your area.","When a person has experienced known or probable exposure to a high dose of radiation from an accident or attack, medical personnel take a number of steps to determine the absorbed radiation dose. This information is essential for determining how serious the illness is likely to be, which treatments to use and whether a person is likely to survive.
Information important for determining an absorbed dose includes:
Known exposure.Details about distance from the source of radiation and duration of exposure can help provide a rough estimate of the severity of radiation sickness.
Vomiting and other symptoms.The time between radiation exposure and when vomiting starts is a fairly accurate screening tool to estimate absorbed radiation dose. The shorter the time before vomiting starts, the higher the dose. The severity and timing of other symptoms also may help medical personnel determine the absorbed dose.
Blood tests.Frequent blood tests over several days enable medical personnel to look for drops in disease-fighting white blood cells and unusual changes in the DNA of blood cells. These factors indicate the degree of bone marrow damage, which is determined by the level of an absorbed dose.
Dosimeter.A device called a dosimeter can measure the absorbed dose of radiation but only if it was exposed to the same radiation event as the affected person.
Survey meter.A device such as a Geiger counter can be used to test people to see where in the body radioactive particles are located.
Type of radiation.A part of the larger emergency response to a radioactive accident or attack would include identifying the type of radiation exposure. This information would guide some decisions for treating people with radiation sickness.","The treatment goals for radiation sickness are to prevent further radioactive contamination; treat life-threatening injuries, such as from burns and trauma; reduce symptoms; and manage pain.",,"exposures, radiation sickness"
ARDS,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occurs when lung swelling causes fluid to build up in the tiny elastic air sacs in the lungs. These air sacs, called alveoli, have a protective membrane, but lung swelling damages that membrane. The fluid leaking into the air sacs keeps the lungs from filling with enough air. This means less oxygen reaches the bloodstream, so the body's organs don't get the oxygen they need to work properly.
ARDS usually occurs in people who are already critically ill or have major injuries. People usually are severely short of breath — the main symptom of ARDS — within a few hours to a few days after the injury or infection that caused ARDS.
Many people who get ARDS don't survive. The risk of death gets higher with age and how severe the illness is. Of the people who survive ARDS, some fully recover. But others have lasting lung damage.","The seriousness of ARDS symptoms can vary depending on what's causing them and whether there is underlying heart or lung disease. Symptoms include:
Severe shortness of breath.
Labored and rapid breathing that is not usual.
Cough.
Chest discomfort.
Fast heart rate.
Confusion and extreme tiredness.","Causes of ARDS include:
Sepsis.The most common cause of ARDS is sepsis, a serious and widespread infection of the bloodstream.
Severe pneumonia.Severe cases of pneumonia usually affect all five lobes of the lungs.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).People who have severe COVID-19 may get ARDS. Because COVID-19 mainly affects the respiratory system, it can cause lung injury and swelling that can lead to COVID-19-related ARDS.
Head, chest or other major injury.Accidents, such as falls or car crashes, can damage the lungs or the portion of the brain that controls breathing.
Breathing in harmful substances.Breathing in a lot of smoke or chemical fumes can lead to ARDS, as can breathing in vomit. Breathing in water in cases of near-drownings also can cause ARDS.
Other conditions and treatments.Swelling of the pancreas (pancreatitis), massive blood transfusions and severe burns can lead to ARDS.",,"There's no specific test for ARDS. Healthcare professionals base the diagnosis on physical exams, chest X-rays and oxygen levels. It's also important to rule out other diseases and conditions, such as certain heart problems that can lead to similar symptoms.","The first goal in treating ARDS is to improve the levels of oxygen in your blood. Without oxygen, your organs can't work properly.",,"tiredness, rapid breathing, labored, labored breathing, chest discomfort, fast heart rate, extreme tiredness, confusion, ards, cough, shortness of breath"
Acute sinusitis,"Acute sinusitis causes the spaces inside the nose, known as sinuses, to become inflamed and swollen. Acute sinusitis makes it hard for the sinuses to drain. Mucus builds up.
Acute sinusitis can make it hard to breathe through the nose. The area around the eyes and the face might feel swollen. There might be throbbing face pain or a headache.
The common cold is the usual cause of acute sinusitis. Most often, the condition clears up within a week to 10 days unless there's also an infection caused by bacteria, called a bacterial infection. Home remedies might be all that's needed to treat acute sinusitis. Sinusitis that lasts more than 12 weeks even with medical treatment is called chronic sinusitis.","Acute sinusitis symptoms often include:
Thick, yellow or greenish mucus from the nose, known as a runny nose, or down the back of the throat, known as postnasal drip.
Blocked or stuffy nose, known as congestion. This makes it hard to breathe through the nose.
Pain, tenderness, swelling and pressure around the eyes, cheeks, nose or forehead that gets worse when bending over.
Other signs and symptoms include:
Ear pressure.
Headache.
Aching in the teeth.
Changed sense of smell.
Cough.
Bad breath.
Tiredness.
Fever.","Acute sinusitis is an infection caused by a virus. The common cold is most often the cause. Sometimes, sinuses that are blocked for a time might get a bacterial infection.","Take these steps to help lower your risk of getting acute sinusitis:
Stay well.Try to stay away from people who have colds or other infections. Wash your hands often with soap and water, such as before meals.
Manage allergies.Work with your health care provider to keep symptoms under control.
Avoid cigarette smoke and polluted air.Tobacco smoke and other pollutants can irritate lungs and inside the nose, known as nasal passages.
Use a machine that adds moisture to the air, known as a humidifier.If the air in your home is dry, adding moisture to the air may help prevent sinusitis. Be sure the humidifier stays clean and free of mold with regular, complete cleaning.","A health care provider might ask about symptoms and do an exam. The exam might include feeling for tenderness in the nose and face and looking inside the nose.
Other ways to diagnose acute sinusitis and rule out other conditions include:
Nasal endoscopy.A health care provider inserts a thin, flexible tube, known as an endoscope, into the nose. A light on the tube allows the provider to see inside the sinuses.
Imaging studies.A CT scan can show details of the sinuses and nasal area. It's not usually used for simple acute sinusitis. But imaging studies might help rule out other causes.
Nasal and sinus samples.Lab tests aren't often used to diagnose acute sinusitis. But if the condition doesn't get better with treatment or gets worse, tissue samples from the nose or sinuses might help find the cause.",Most cases of acute sinusitis get better on their own. Self-care is usually all that's needed to ease symptoms.,Here's information to help you get ready for your appointment.,"pain, cough, throat, headache, postnasal, swelling, tiredness, congestion, pressure, fever, ear pressure, aching, postnasal drip, acute sinusitis symptoms, bad breath, tenderness, runny nose, changed sense of smell"
Autoimmune epilepsy,"Autoimmune epilepsy is a type of epilepsy where seizures are caused by the immune system mistakenly attacking brain cells. It can occur with conditions that affect the immune system, especially autoimmune encephalitis.
Autoimmune epilepsy also is known as autoimmune associated epilepsy and acute symptomatic seizures secondary to autoimmune encephalitis.
The immune system protects the body from viruses, bacteria and other substances that can cause illnesses. Antibodies are proteins that are part of the immune system. In autoimmune epilepsy, antibodies mistakenly target receptors in the brain. This leads to swelling in the brain, also known as inflammation, and seizures.
Antiseizure medicines usually don't do enough to manage seizures in people with autoimmune epilepsy. Instead, immunotherapy medicines help reduce the immune response on the brain.
When immunotherapy is started early, it can reduce inflammation and improve seizures. For some people, treatment can stop seizures completely. For others, seizures may continue after treatment.","Symptoms of autoimmune epilepsy may begin after an illness with a fever. Seizures come on suddenly and are serious. The types of seizures that may occur include:
Focal seizures.These are the most common type of seizure in autoimmune epilepsy. Sometimes focal seizures cause a change or loss of awareness. The seizures may cause the person to stare and not respond to the environment. Other types of focal seizures don't cause a change in awareness. These seizures cause different symptoms depending on which part of the brain causes them. Focal seizures may cause one part of the body to shake. Or they may cause a feeling that his has happened before, known as déjà vu. Focal seizures also may cause nausea or vision symptoms, such as flashing lights.
Faciobrachial dystonic seizures.These seizures cause muscle contractions on one side of the face and in an arm, both on the same side of the body.
Symptoms related to seizures include:
Seizures that happen several times a day.
Seizures that don't go away with antiseizure medicines.
Seizures that last more than five minutes or that occur close together without the person regaining consciousness, known as status epilepticus.
Autoimmune epilepsy symptoms also may include:
Memory loss and trouble with thinking.
Personality and behavior changes.
Involuntary movements or clumsy movements.
Irregular eye movements.
Changes in heart rate, blood pressure and other automatic functions.","Autoimmune epilepsy is caused by the immune system attacking brain cells and leading to seizures. Antibodies are part of the immune system. They usually protect the body from viruses and infections. But in autoimmune conditions, the immune system attacks healthy cells. More recently, research has concluded that epilepsy can be an autoimmune disease.
Autoimmune epilepsy causes may include:
Autoimmune encephalitis.Autoimmune encephalitis (en-sef-uh-LIE-tis) is a group of conditions that causes swelling in the brain. This happens because the immune system mistakenly attacks brain cells. Autoimmune encephalitis causes a variety of symptoms, including seizures. It is the most common cause of autoimmune epilepsy. Certain types of autoimmune encephalitis are commonly linked to autoimmune epilepsy and are associated with antibodies that target NMDA-receptors, LGI1, CASPR2 and GAD65.
Rasmussen syndrome.In this condition, immune cells known as T cells cause inflammation and brain damage that lead to seizures. People with autoimmune epilepsy due to Rasmussen syndrome may continue to have seizures after treatment.
Cancer.Sometimes tumors trigger the immune system to attack healthy brain cells, known as paraneoplastic syndrome. This can lead to epilepsy.","You may not be able to prevent autoimmune epilepsy. But getting cancer screenings can help your healthcare professional find tumors and treat them early. This could prevent autoimmune encephalitis triggered by cancers, which can be a cause of epilepsy. Talk with your healthcare professional about your cancer risk and if you should get screened for certain cancers.","An autoimmune epilepsy diagnosis begins with a physical exam and a review of your symptoms.
Testings for autoimmune epilepsy includes lab tests, brain imaging and testing the electrical activity in the brain.","Autoimmune epilepsy treatment differs from the treatment used for other types of epilepsy. Healthcare professionals use immunotherapy to reduce the immune system activity and treat seizures.
If cancer is the cause of autoimmune epilepsy, treating the cancer is an important part of treatment.","If your symptoms are serious, you might need emergency medical care.
If your symptoms are less serious, you may start by seeing your healthcare professional. Or you may be referred right away to a doctor who specializes in nervous system conditions, known as a neurologist.","nausea, autoimmune epilepsy symptoms, involuntary movements, autoimmune epilepsy, seizure, memory loss, stare, Here are the extracted medical symptoms:

Alcohol use disorder,"Alcohol use disorder is a pattern of alcohol use that involves problems controlling your drinking, being preoccupied with alcohol or continuing to use alcohol even when it causes problems. This disorder also involves having to drink more to get the same effect or having withdrawal symptoms when you rapidly decrease or stop drinking. Alcohol use disorder includes a level of drinking that's sometimes called alcoholism.
Unhealthy alcohol use includes any alcohol use that puts your health or safety at risk or causes other alcohol-related problems. It also includes binge drinking — a pattern of drinking where a male has five or more drinks within two hours or a female has at least four drinks within two hours. Binge drinking causes significant health and safety risks.
If your pattern of drinking results in repeated significant distress and problems functioning in your daily life, you likely have alcohol use disorder. It can range from mild to severe. However, even a mild disorder can escalate and lead to serious problems, so early treatment is important.","Alcohol use disorder can be mild, moderate or severe, based on the number of symptoms you experience. Signs and symptoms may include:
Being unable to limit the amount of alcohol you drink
Wanting to cut down on how much you drink or making unsuccessful attempts to do so
Spending a lot of time drinking, getting alcohol or recovering from alcohol use
Feeling a strong craving or urge to drink alcohol
Failing to fulfill major obligations at work, school or home due to repeated alcohol use
Continuing to drink alcohol even though you know it's causing physical, social, work or relationship problems
Giving up or reducing social and work activities and hobbies to use alcohol
Using alcohol in situations where it's not safe, such as when driving or swimming
Developing a tolerance to alcohol so you need more to feel its effect or you have a reduced effect from the same amount
Experiencing withdrawal symptoms — such as nausea, sweating and shaking — when you don't drink, or drinking to avoid these symptoms
Alcohol use disorder can include periods of being drunk (alcohol intoxication) and symptoms of withdrawal.
Alcohol intoxicationresults as the amount of alcohol in your bloodstream increases. The higher the blood alcohol concentration is, the more likely you are to have bad effects. Alcohol intoxication causes behavior problems and mental changes. These may include inappropriate behavior, unstable moods, poor judgment, slurred speech, problems with attention or memory, and poor coordination. You can also have periods called ""blackouts,"" where you don't remember events. Very high blood alcohol levels can lead to coma, permanent brain damage or even death.
Alcohol withdrawalcan occur when alcohol use has been heavy and prolonged and is then stopped or greatly reduced. It can occur within several hours to 4 to 5 days later. Signs and symptoms include sweating, rapid heartbeat, hand tremors, problems sleeping, nausea and vomiting, hallucinations, restlessness and agitation, anxiety, and occasionally seizures. Symptoms can be severe enough to impair your ability to function at work or in social situations.","Genetic, psychological, social and environmental factors can impact how drinking alcohol affects your body and behavior. Theories suggest that for certain people drinking has a different and stronger impact that can lead to alcohol use disorder.
Over time, drinking too much alcohol may change the normal function of the areas of your brain associated with the experience of pleasure, judgment and the ability to exercise control over your behavior. This may result in craving alcohol to try to restore good feelings or reduce negative ones.","Early intervention can prevent alcohol-related problems in teens. If you have a teenager, be alert to signs and symptoms that may indicate a problem with alcohol:
Loss of interest in activities and hobbies and in personal appearance
Red eyes, slurred speech, problems with coordination and memory lapses
Difficulties or changes in relationships with friends, such as joining a new crowd
Declining grades and problems in school
Frequent mood changes and defensive behavior
You can help prevent teenage alcohol use:
Set a good example with your own alcohol use.
Talk openly with your child, spend quality time together and become actively involved in your child's life.
Let your child know what behavior you expect — and what the consequences will be for not following the rules.","You're likely to start by seeing your primary health care provider. If your provider suspects that you have a problem with alcohol, you may be referred to a mental health provider.
To assess your problem with alcohol, your provider will likely:
Ask you some questions related to your drinking habits.The provider may ask for permission to speak with family members or friends. However, confidentiality laws prevent your provider from giving out any information about you without your consent.
Perform a physical exam.Your health care provider may do a physical exam and ask questions about your health. There are many physical signs that indicate complications of alcohol use.
Suggest lab tests and imaging tests.While there are no specific tests to diagnose alcohol use disorder, certain patterns of lab test results may strongly suggest it. And you may need tests to identify health problems that may be linked to your alcohol use. Damage to your organs may be seen on tests.
Complete a psychological evaluation.This evaluation includes questions about your symptoms, thoughts, feelings and behavior patterns. You may be asked to complete a questionnaire to help answer these questions.","Treatment for alcohol use disorder can vary, depending on your needs. Treatment may involve a brief intervention, individual or group counseling, an outpatient program, or a residential inpatient stay. Working to stop alcohol use to improve quality of life is the main treatment goal.
Treatment for alcohol use disorder may include:
Detox and withdrawal.Treatment may begin with a program of detoxification — withdrawal that's medically managed. Sometimes called detox, this generally takes 2 to 7 days. You may need to take sedating medications to prevent withdrawal symptoms. Detox is usually done at an inpatient treatment center or a hospital.
Learning new skills and making a treatment plan.This process usually involves alcohol treatment specialists. It may include goal setting, behavior change techniques, use of self-help manuals, counseling and follow-up care at a treatment center.
Psychological counseling.Counseling and therapy for groups and individuals help you better understand your problem with alcohol and support recovery from the psychological aspects of alcohol use. You may benefit from couples or family therapy — family support can be an important part of the recovery process.
Oral medications.A drug called disulfiram may help prevent you from drinking, although it won't cure alcohol use disorder or remove the urge to drink. If you drink alcohol while taking disulfiram, the drug produces a physical reaction that may include flushing, nausea, vomiting and headaches.Naltrexone, a drug that blocks the good feelings alcohol causes, may prevent heavy drinking and reduce the urge to drink. Acamprosate may help you combat alcohol cravings once you stop drinking. Unlike disulfiram, naltrexone and acamprosate don't make you feel sick after taking a drink.
Injected medication.Vivitrol, a version of the drug naltrexone, is injected once a month by a health care professional. Although similar medication can be taken in pill form, the injectable version of the drug may be easier for people recovering from alcohol use disorder to use consistently.
Continuing support.Aftercare programs and support groups help people recovering from alcohol use disorder to stop drinking, manage relapses and cope with necessary lifestyle changes. This may include medical or psychological care or attending a support group.
Treatment for psychological problems.Alcohol use disorder commonly occurs along with other mental health disorders. If you have depression, anxiety or another mental health condition, you may need talk therapy (psychotherapy), medications or other treatment.
Medical treatment for health conditions.Many alcohol-related health problems improve significantly once you stop drinking. But some health conditions may warrant continued treatment and follow-up care.
Spiritual practice.People who are involved with some type of regular spiritual practice may find it easier to maintain recovery from alcohol use disorder or other addictions. For many people, gaining greater insight into their spiritual side is a key element in recovery.","Here's some information to help you get ready for your appointment, and what to expect from your health care provider or mental health provider.
